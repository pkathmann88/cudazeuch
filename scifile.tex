% The preamble here sets up a lot of new/revised commands and
% environments.  It's annoying, but please do *not* try to strip these
% out into a separate .sty file (which could lead to the loss of some
% information when we convert the file to other formats).  Instead, keep
% them in the preamble of your main LaTeX source file.


% The following parameters seem to provide a reasonable page setup.

\topmargin 0.0cm
\oddsidemargin 0.2cm
\textwidth 16cm 
\textheight 21cm
\footskip 1.0cm


%The next command sets up an environment for the abstract to your paper.

% The following lines set up an environment for the last note in the
% reference list, which commonly includes acknowledgments of funding,
% help, etc.  It's intended for users of BibTeX or the {thebibliography}
% environment.  Users who are hand-coding their references at the end
% using a list environment such as {enumerate} can simply add another
% item at the end, and it will be numbered automatically.

% Place your abstract within the special {sciabstract} environment.

\begin{sciabstract}
  This document presents a number of hints about how to set up your
  {\it Science\/} paper in \LaTeX\ .  We provide a template file,
  \texttt{scifile.tex}, that you can use to set up the \LaTeX\ source
  for your article.  An example of the style is the special
  \texttt{\{sciabstract\}} environment used to set up the abstract you
  see here.
\end{sciabstract}

\include{introduction}

\include{implementation}

\include{messergebnisse}

% Your references go at the end of the main text, and before the
% figures.  For this document we've used BibTeX, the .bib file
% scibib.bib, and the .bst file Science.bst.  The package scicite.sty
% was included to format the reference numbers according to *Science*
% style.


\bibliography{scibib}

\bibliographystyle{Science}



% Following is a new environment, {scilastnote}, that's defined in the
% preamble and that allows authors to add a reference at the end of the
% list that's not signaled in the text; such references are used in
% *Science* for acknowledgments of funding, help, etc.

\begin{scilastnote}
\item We've included in the template file \texttt{scifile.tex} a new
environment, \texttt{\{scilastnote\}}, that generates a numbered final
citation without a corresponding signal in the text.  This environment
can be used to generate a final numbered reference containing
acknowledgments, sources of funding, and the like, per {\it Science\/}
style.  Along those lines, we'd like to thank readers of this document
for their attention, and invite them to address any questions to
Stewart Wills, at swills@aaas.org.
\end{scilastnote}




% For your review copy (i.e., the file you initially send in for
% evaluation), you can use the {figure} environment and the
% \includegraphics command to stream your figures into the text, placing
% all figures at the end.  For the final, revised manuscript for
% acceptance and production, however, PostScript or other graphics
% should not be streamed into your compliled file.  Instead, set
% captions as simple paragraphs (with a \noindent tag), setting them
% off from the rest of the text with a \clearpage as shown  below, and
% submit figures as separate files according to the Art Department's
% instructions.


\clearpage

\noindent {\bf Fig. 1.} Please do not use figure environments to set
up your figures in the final (post-peer-review) draft, do not include graphics in your
source code, and do not cite figures in the text using \LaTeX\
\verb+\ref+ commands.  Instead, simply refer to the figure numbers in
the text per {\it Science\/} style, and include the list of captions at
the end of the document, coded as ordinary paragraphs as shown in the
\texttt{scifile.tex} template file.  Your actual figure files should
be submitted separately.
